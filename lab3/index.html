		<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures</h1>
		<p>
			This lab is supposed to make us comfortable with making, finding, and
			navigating files of variable kinds.
		</p>

		<h2><u>Difficulties</u></h2>
		<p>
			Our file structure was prefabricated, but it was indeed tricky finding
			the correct manner to copy it from the GitHub template.
		</p>

		<h2><u>Results</u></h2>
		<p>
			You are currently using the product of my efforts for this lab!
