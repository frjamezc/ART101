    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Nothing about this lab was particularly challenging for me, however the
      problems I did encounter stemmed from my confusion with the lab doc's
      wording.

    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>
      The lab doc wasn't clear on what it wanted me to  do after I've created
      and configured my HTML  elements in the JavaScript code. My guess is to
      write it to the web page using document.writeln();
