      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        There wasn't many challenges for me, as I am pretty familiar with the
        JavaScript language. I will use this section to layout my Bonus
        points.

      <h3>**Bonus**</h3>
      <p>
        1. The sort() method sorts the calling array in ascending order. Since
        we split our string into an array of characters, the order is determined
        via lexicographic order of ASCII values. Therefore, capitalized letters
        are placed before lower cased letters in after the sort() method is
        called. We can sort lower and uppercased letters together by
        implementing a comparison function that returns 0 if the consecutive
        array elements are of the same letter but different cases, and the
        result of a.localeCompare(b) otherwise. We pass this function into the
        sort method, finally creating a desired array of cases sorted together.

      <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>
          The only problems I faced this lab was trying to figure out what the
          join() function did in our JavaScript code. After a google search, I
          found out that it creates a string representation of a given array.
          By default, the elements are separated by commas in the returned
          string. For the purpose of this lab I separated them by the empty
          string: ''. I did this in order to output the Fixed Name as a normal
          looking string.
