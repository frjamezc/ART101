        The primary challenge was figuring out the jQuery code syntax. The
        nuances became clear after a bit of practice but the amount of nested
        curly braces and parentheses coupled with the multitudinous uses of
        anonymous functions made me want to pull my hair out.

        Elijah and I didn't have many problems besides debugging. The number of
        references to elements in css-style fashion was strenuous on my css
        knowledge. Finding how to make a button within our JavaScript file was
        relatively easy, and the addition of event listeners was straight
        forward.

        The results of our efforts are shown by the actions of the buttons you
        see above this sentence.
